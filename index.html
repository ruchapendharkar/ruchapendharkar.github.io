<h1>Hi, I'm Rucha! </h1>

<p>I like making things with wires and screws, with words and color, pixels and paint â€” whatever I have, really!</p>

<p>This page is part of an experiment to explore an artistic side of myself I've only recently discovered; a gentle return to the joy of trying things just for the sake of trying.</p>

<p>I don't exactly know what this will become, and that's kind of the point.</p>
