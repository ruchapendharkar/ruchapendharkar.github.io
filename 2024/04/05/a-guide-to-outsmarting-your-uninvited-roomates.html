<p>Living in certain Boston neighborhoods, such as Mission Hill, Fenway, Park Drive or Brookline, often comes with a guaranteed encounter with a common foe – the mouse. This piece compiles practical advice gathered from personal experiences, insights and the internet (reddit), aiming to guide you through the challenges of dealing with these pesky creatures.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you ever think you’ve spotted a mouse, trust your instincts – you probably did. Don’t let your roommates gaslight you into thinking you’re seeing things. Trust me, they’ll have their own mouse showdown sooner or later. And if your roommates scream <em>“Mouse!”</em> believe them and spring into action!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resist the temptation to give your mouse a name. Sure, Mickey sounds adorable, and Jerry is cute but remember, we’re talking about your sworn enemy here. Humanizing the foe won’t make the battle any easier – keep your mindset sharp.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mouse traps never trap anything. As a beginner, you might be tempted to try the innocent (and cheap) glue trap, wanting to release the mouse into a forest or a park. You might think, I don’t want to kill him for no reason. Don’t be a fool. The innocent-looking glue trap may seem like a humane choice, but it’s more likely to catch dust than mice.</p>

    <p>Enter the classic transparent cage, a seemingly ingenious contraption. Picture a long, hollow tube with a few air holes and a clever trap door. Here’s the catch (pun intended): bait needs to be strategically placed at both ends. Once our unsuspecting mouse ventures inside for a snack, it triggers the trap door, effectively sealing the entrance. Sounds foolproof, right? Not quite. Mice aren’t fond of elaborate dining experiences; they’d rather snatch the food off the door and dash away. Sometimes, the trap may deploy due to a subtle vibration from the refrigerator or dishwasher, leaving you with a false alarm.</p>

    <p>Next we have the popular and classic snap mouse trap, popularly seen in Tom &amp; Jerry. This trap is more harmful to humans than to rodents. There’s a greater chance of hurting one of your fingers than catching a mouse. Do not use this, especially if you are clumsy (like me) and have no experienced people around you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mice adore corners and dark crevices, especially around kitchens. Use traps strategically to block these sneaky entry and exit points. And remember, mice are surprisingly good jumpers, so don’t underestimate their acrobatic skills when blocking entrances!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t waste time building a maze to guide Jerry out. He will climb over it and not respect your efforts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t panic and call your dad. He will ask you to get a cat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spraying essential oils around entrances might make your apartment smell delightful, but Jerry couldn’t care less.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Playing cat sounds does not work. You’ll only feel sad that you never had a pet cat (Thanks Mom), and we don’t want to go down that spiral.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike dogs, treating your mouse like a pet i.e calling out his name fondly (if you ignore advice (2)), will not cause him to come running out to meet you. They do get zoomies though. Asking him to leave nicely (saying things like please, thank you) also do not work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your male friends are equally scared of mice. They will offer stupid suggestions like <em>keep some cheese out for him</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Throw out cardboard boxes or anything mice can chew through. Do clean your kitchen every night before sleeping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speak to your family and friends. Sometimes this war gets emotionally and mentally exhausting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mice love peanut butter, more than cheese! But don’t put it out every day. Knowing that there is peanut butter waiting for them every night makes them visit your home even more. I wasted eight days putting peanut butter on the traps, only to find the food gone and the trap intact the next morning. At that point I felt Jerry was having fun with me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seal the gaps between your room doors and the floor. There’s a sticky foam-plastic tape available on Amazon for $8. Stick it to the bottom of your doors. As an added bonus it also helps soundproof the room. Make sure your mouse is localized to only one area of the apartment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reach out to your maintenance team. Pen down your encounters in a descriptive fashion, and send these out to them in a timely manner. Annoy them into coming up with creative solutions. They will always fill up non existent holes in the wall. They may try and delay the pest control, but it’s your right to demand one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reality check: You will have mice in your apartment even if you have a spotless kitchen. Having a clean kitchen is always better. Do not let the pest control guy, or the maintenance team gaslight you into believing your kitchen is unclean. They will try to blame it on you. So make sure to get important areas checked out, especially the back of the stove and refrigerator.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The entire city of Boston moves in August. And so do mice. Be extra vigilant during the months of August and September.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always wear closed toe footwear while dealing with them. Mice, especially barn mice, can be really small. A broom is your best friend. If you see a mouse do not be afraid to whack him</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always remember - They are more scared of you, than you are of them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It may seem like I’ll be able to handle my next mouse encounter, but I really won’t. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. So I decided to write this article to put all of this random knowledge I had about mice to good use.</p>

<p>The war (Apartment 1209 vs Jerry) ended on 9th September 2023. After a good month of setting traps, moving furniture around, coaxing him out and trying every trick in the book - my roommate found him lying on the kitchen floor. She whacked him with a broom for good measure, and threw him out the balcony. She can be quite gutsy.</p>

<p>We never knew what worked in the end. All that mattered was the war was over.</p>
