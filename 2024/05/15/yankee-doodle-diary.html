    <p>With the arrival of spring after my first winter in Boston, my friends and I found a new hobby; day trips to the New England shore. Despite being a stone’s throw away from Boston, each promises a unique experience.</p>

<hr />

<h2> Newport, Rhode Island </h2>

<p>A trip to the Ocean State made me realize why the Northeast America is called <em>New England</em>.</p>

<p>We started our visit with the State House in Providence. This is a must see for any history geek! The different board rooms are open to public for viewing, but they also have some cool artifacts from the civil war. One highlight was the old canon they used in the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>While Providence was like any other modern day New England city (not as many Dunkins as Massachusetts though), Newport will transport you back to Colonial times. The city of Newport is also referred to as the <em>summer playground of the American barons of industry</em> and I could see why. With small brightly colored houses, European style churches and clock towers, this coastal city exudes charm. We visited Newport in early spring and were blessed with views of cherry blossoms and tulips. The wharf is known for outstanding seafood, and fun ocean themed restaurants. Despite not indulging in the seafood myself, I have to admit that the old oil-lamps, elevated bar stools and rustic furniture, anchors and chains everywhere perfectly recreates the experience of having lunch inside a ship like <em>the Pirates of the Caribbean!</em></p>

<p>It took us forty minutes, but we walked across the city to visit Easton’s Beach. Along the way we saw beautiful homes and small vintage shops selling the odd knick-knacks. Easton’s beach was beautiful, with views of a stormy grey Atlantic. Our main destination, however was Cliff Walk. This walking trail has views of the ocean on your left, and century old, gorgeous mansions on your right, as you walk along a rocky cliff. Most of these mansions were rumoured to be owned by big time celebrities and pop-stars. The trail forks off at places, allowing you to descend closer to the ocean. The sound of the waves crashing into the rocks is loud, but oddly calming. The highlight of this trail is the Breaker’s Mansion, the grandest of all the homes. While it was closed when we visited, the aesthetics will remind you of a scene from <em>Bridgerton</em></p>

<p>We ended the day with a trip to the Beavertail Lighthouse at sunset. This is the third oldest lighthouse in all of America. It offers you unbridled views of the ocean. Legend has it that continuing in a straight line from this point would lead one all the way to Europe. It also has a small museum which talks about the role of this lighthouse in the World Wars. There’s a bunch of rocks you can sit on, closer to the water and watch the sun touch the water. A perfect way to end the day.</p>

<h2> Plum Island, Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Just along the border of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, lies the idyllic town of Gloucester. This is further up north from the famous Manchester-by-the-Sea. We visited Stage Fort Park which overlooked Cape Ann. The daises were in full bloom in the August heat. It was our lucky day - after exploring around a bit more, we stumbled on a town fair, and a vintage car show. My, oh my was that a treat! Brightly colored Mustangs, Corvette Sting Rays, Fords and so many more cars gleaming in the sun. I’m not that knowledgeable about cars, but I was excited nevertheless. I miss the pastel pop of color cars had, before all of them turned vanilla monochrome with a few odd reds and blues. Grumpy old Americans trying to stop strangers from touching their vintage cars, while nibbling on one of the most atrocious snacks I have seen in my life - deep fried Oreo’s. Gloucester truly captures <em>the Spirit of America</em></p>

<p>After lunch we decided to head to Plum Island to laze around on the beach. The beach was quiet, and not too crowded. The water was a deep blue, perfectly reflecting the sky. It was warm where the sun shone, and cold in the shadows. We didn’t do much except laze around, talk, play football, and make holes in the sand. Plum Island also has a private airfield, right next to the beach. We headed to Newburyport after, for some ice-cream. It had a small downtown, with quaint shops. There was a small harbour with a lot of private yachts; I assume the assets of the uber wealthy residents of <em>Beantown</em>. I am a firm believer that local ice-cream parlors make better ice cream than big brand chains. And I was right, the ice cream was extremely delicious.</p>

<p>And while it was annoying to get the sand out of my shoes (and the car), I could not have thought of a better way to spend a sunny summer Saturday.</p>

<h2> Portland, Maine </h2>

<p>As you cross over the state border, a sign reads <em>“Welcome to Maine: The Way Life Should Be”</em>. There’s a faint trace of salt in the air, and you begin to spot seagulls in the sky. The trees grew taller, straight and denser. I’ve always been partial to views of forests, ocean and mountains together. On a warm spring day, this feels extremely pleasant. This <em>is</em> how life should be.</p>

<p>Our first stop was a local bakery chain - The Holy Donut. Donuts don’t particularly excite me anymore (side effects of having too many Dunkins in Massachusetts), this one however is worth the visit. Made entirely out of potato, instead of wheat or flour, these gluten-free donuts were probably the best I’ve had in my life. They were dense, yet extremely soft with a variety of toppings and fillings. Definitely worth a visit!</p>

<p>Exploring downtown Portland revealed a quaint yet charming cityscape, with scattered buildings surrounding a picturesque park. We made our way to the Eastern Promenade Trail. This is a scenic walking trail along the Casco Bay. The water touches the sky, in an endless stretch of blue in front of you. There were a few kids picnicking and people were lazing on the lawns. A section of the trail branches off to a small beach. The views are spectacular, and if you are lucky you might run into some playful dogs here.</p>

<p>After rolling around in the grass and taking in some much needed sun, we went to another local chain for lunch. Otto’s Pizza. I’d had Otto’s Pizza in Boston before, but I was excited to try the original in Portland. It did not disappoint. They had a bunch of different toppings - pineapples, roasted eggplants, and probably the weirdest - mashed potato. For a town with a reputation for lobster rolls, the potato seemed to be making it’s way into a lot of their food. I wonder what that is about.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon visiting the Bug Lighthouse and the surrounding park in South Portland. People were flying kites and there were a lot of older grandparents out for an afternoon stroll. This was a small lighthouse, which was supposed to be inspired by a monument in Athens. The wharf and docks were the busiest part of the city. However everything closes down as soon as the clock strikes 5pm. We ended the day with our final stop -the famous Portland Headlight. This is Maine’s oldest lighthouse, overlooking the wondrous Cape Elizabeth. Built with white stone, with red sloping roofs and white picket fence, this lighthouse will remind you of a scene from a quintessential European town. The golden hour just made it even more stunning.</p>

<hr />

<p>Whether it’s the bustling harbor of Newport, the sandy shores of Plum Island, or the serene Promenade, one tradition remains steadfast; no trip is complete without a lively round of Monopoly Deal on the sun-kissed grass (or sand). Oblivious to the amused looks, we trade properties and lose most of our money, while we try to stop our cards from flying away in the cool ocean breeze.</p>
